# Appliances-Energy-Prediction-by-Linear-Regression
The Dataset is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network.Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy metres. Weather from the nearest airport weather station(Chievres Airport,Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru) and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non-predictive attributes. You need to predict the energy use of appliances.

1.What is the mean comparison of all the features with every other feature?\
2.What is the Energy Consumption by Appliances per month?\
3.What is the Energy Consumption by Appliances per day arranged according to months?\
4.What is the Energy consumption for individual hour of day in total 4.5 months?\
5.On which day of the week, the energy consumption is highest
